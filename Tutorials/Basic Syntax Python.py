# Class name starts with upper case
# Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.
# Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.
# If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.

#A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within parentheses.
#The main differences between lists and tuples are: Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and their elements and size can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and cannot be updated. Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists.

#Python Dictionary

#Python's dictionaries are kind of hash table type. They work like associative arrays or hashes found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python object.
