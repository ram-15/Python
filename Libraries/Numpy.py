#NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for #processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed. This tutorial explains the basics of #NumPy such as its architecture and environment. It also discusses the various array functions, types of indexing, etc. An introduction to #Matplotlib is also provided. All this is explained with the help of examples for better understanding.

Comment exapmle! not actually a comment

NumPy is often used along with packages like SciPy (Scientific Python) and Matâˆ’plotlib (plotting library). This combination is widely used as a replacement for MatLab, a popular platform for technical computing. However, Python alternative to MatLab is now seen as a more modern and complete programming language.
The ndarray object consists of contiguous one-dimensional segment of computer memory, combined with an indexing scheme that maps each item to a location in the memory block.
